Snapshot 0.1.3 (2004-11-24 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
==========================================================
After the recent server compromise we discarded all unsigned
snapshots. That left us without a pycairo snapshot.

Additionally, there were no tags in the source repository so I
couldn't recreate the 0.1.2 snapshot, so here's a new 0.1.3 snapshot.

I apologize if I botched the version number or left something
significant out of this announcement---I'm not the one who will
usually be doing pycairo maintenance.

New bindings:
	current_path
	current_path_flat
	current_font_extents

Changes:
	fill_extents,stroke_extents: Remove unnecessary args and
	change from a method to an attribute.

Other:
	Added two new examples: context-subclass.py and warpedtext.py

Snapshot 0.1.2 (2004-11-14 Steve Chaplin <steve1097@yahoo.com.au>
=================================================================
First snapshot for PyCairo

Support added for patterns.
Support added for cairo_set_target_png() and cairo_set_target_ps()

Add LGPL/MPL license.
